                        Their love story began at a festival in Oakland, California. Their first date was memorable,
                        during which they faced linguistic barriers and cultural differences, and taking the opportunity
                        to connect and explore the unknown with excitement. It was a night full of laughter,
                        conversations that transcended words and shared sensation that something magical had begun. Both
                        Mike and Karen had recently moved to Oakland, each starting a new chapter in their lives. Mike
                        had just graduated from university, starting his first job, while Karen, from Bogot√°, took the
                        brave decision to be an au pair, embracing the challenges and joys of working with her new host
                        family in a foreign country.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        In those early moments of their relationship, amid the multicultural backdrop of the Bay Area,
                        they realized how their differences complement each other. Mike's impulsive, carefree spirit
                        found balance in Karen's careful planning and artistic nature. They quickly discovered that her
                        childish, almost secret sense of humor was the key to an intimate connection that transcended
                        words. They had never laughed so hard, nor had they been so happy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        On their journey, they have shown that love is more than just beautiful moments; It's about
                        being there for each other in times of joy and sadness, stress and relaxation. Their love is a
                        partnership where each gives their all, especially when the other can only offer a fraction.
                        Together, they have faced life's challenges and celebrated its victories, knowing that their
                        love is unbreakable, their commitment strong, and their dedication to each other steadfast. As
                        we stand here today, celebrating their love, we witness not only the beginning of their
                        marriage, but also the beautiful journey ahead of them. We witness the promise that Mike and
                        Karen make to each other, a promise of love, support, and endless laughter. A promise to nurture
                        their unique connection and value the differences that make them who they are.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        So let's celebrate Mike and Karen, the love they share, the laughter they have discovered, and
                        the future they have chosen to build together. May your lives be filled with endless moments of
                        joy, may your love continue to grow and evolve, and may you find strength in each other, no
                        matter what life throws at you.

                        From the moment I met you at the train station and you looked at me with those big, beautiful
                        eyes and that infectious smile, I knew I was about to meet a special person. Today, I want to
                        reflect on the incredible person you are and the profound impact you have had on my life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        What has always attracted me the most about you is your love and relationship with your family.
                        I learned that you grew up in the warmth of your grandparents' home, a place full of food,
                        games, laughter, and quality time with your family. As someone who grew up far from his extended
                        family, I envied your childhood. I hope our families play a vital role in our future, offering
                        guidance, love, and unwavering support.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Another aspect I fell in love with is your sense of humor. I have never laughed so much with
                        anyone. I believe this shared sense of humor forms the basis of our strong bond. I also
                        highlight that we have built a relationship based on love, respect, and, of course, excellent
                        communication. Because we never keep things bottled up, we are always honest and transparent
                        about our thoughts and feelings. You keep me honest and humble, and I always seek and respect
                        your opinion. You are my best confidant.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        It has also been incredible to witness how you have built a life for yourself, far from home in
                        a foreign country, and pursued your dreams. I am proud of your unwavering commitment to a career
                        in nursing, whereby you have overcome language barriers to become an outstanding student. Your
                        empathy, sensitivity, and caring nature will be the greatest gifts to your future patients. I
                        can't wait to see what else you accomplish in your life and what we accomplish together.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The list of things I love about you could go on forever. For example, how you turn our house
                        into a home or how I love eating your chickpeas and Menudo. And maybe you don't believe me, but
                        I even love your imperfections, like your infamous bad moods. Because I know they come from a
                        place of love for me and your desire for everything to be perfect. I love you, Karen. You are my
                        best friend and the love of my life. I promise to always respect you, support you in everything,
                        be patient with you, be someone you can trust, take care of you when you are sick, and be by
                        your side no matter what happens. I love you, and thank you for making me the luckiest man in
                        the world.
